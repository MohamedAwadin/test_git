# Blaise Pascal - Basic Calculator  

This repository contains a simple calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The project is a collaborative effort among six ITI Embedded Systems Track INTAKE_45 contributors, each implementing a specific function to showcase teamwork and individual coding skills.  

The name *Blaise Pascal* pays homage to the famous French mathematician, physicist, and inventor Blaise Pascal, who created one of the earliest mechanical calculators, the **Pascaline**, in 1642. Just as Pascal's invention laid the foundation for modern computational devices, this project represents a foundational step in understanding and implementing basic arithmetic operations programmatically.  

## Features  

- **Addition**: Computes the sum of two numbers.  
- **Subtraction**: Finds the difference between two numbers.  
- **Multiplication**: Calculates the product of two numbers.  
- **Division**: Performs division and returns the quotient.  
- **Remainder**: Determines the remainder from the division of two numbers.  
- **Power**: Raises a number to the power of another number.

## Example Usage  

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the calculator:  

```  
Select an operation:  
1. Addition  
2. Subtraction  
3. Multiplication  
4. Division  
5. Remainder  
6. Power  

Enter choice (1-6): 1  
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Result: 10 + 5 = 15  
```
